                            <h2>Lower Carbon Emissions</h2>
                            <p>The reduction in congestion will most likely result in a reduction of CO2 emissions as well.Since software will drive the car, the modern vehicle can now be programmed to reduce emissions to the maximum extent possible. The transition to the new-age cars is expected to contribute to a 60% fall in emissions.</p>.

                            <h2>Less driver-caused accidents</h2>
                            <p> Our experiments show that with as few as 5 percent of vehicles being automated and carefully controlled, we can eliminate stop-and-go waves caused by human driving behavior,” said Daniel B. Work, assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a lead researcher in the traffic congestion study.</p>.

                            <p>Commuters may be dropped at a location and the vehicle would park itself away from the destination, where space is available</p>.

                            <p>Research from the State Smart Transportation Initiative (SSTI) shows potential for autonomous vehicles could increase highway capacity by 100 percent and increase expressway travel speeds by more than 20 percent.</p>.

                            <p>"AVs may cut travel time by up to 40 percent, recover up to 80 billion hours lost to commuting and congestion, and reduce fuel consumption by up to 40 percent. </p>.

Work, assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a lead researcher in the traffic congestion study.Even decreasing the number of accidents could reduce congestion, because up to 25% of congestion is caused by traffic incidents.</p>.
