                <h2>Hacking</h2>
                <p>Hacking is a risk that becomes more and more possible as our vehicles become more autonomous. The more sensors, chips, or any other sort of technology that we continute to add,
                    the more Hackers have available to breach, and destroy. As technology is growing, so are Cyber Attacks and skill of the people behind these Cyber Attacks. The threat hacking poses 
                    to Autonomous Vehicles comes from the ability of these Hackers to breach the sensors, chips, and trackers we have in our cars, and especially things like AutoPilot, which if breached
                    can cause a life taking accident for one, or multiple people on the road.

                <h2>Over-Reliance</h2>
                <p>The danger of Over-Reliance is a big risk in terms of autonomy. By Over reliance, we simply mean relying too highly on the technology provided.
                    Users may have a strong trust in the technology, for example, Teslas autopilot. Over relying on this technology can easily lead to a non-user caused
                    accident. If the technology fails, or is somehow a target in a cyber attack, you are at great risk of harm, or even death in case of a severe accident.
                    Being that Autonomous Vehicles are still fairly new to the spectrum, being over-reliant is a risk that should be avoided, simply for the reason that the
                    technology we have is yet to improve, and saftey from risk will be improved greatly as years pass.
                </p>.

                <h2>Accidental Death</h2>
                <p>Accidental Death is a risk posed by the failure of technology. In the case of Tesla's AutoPilot, an accidental death could occur if the autopilot
                    were to fail. This could happen if a sensor, or chip in the car is damaged, hacked, or malfunctions while the car is moving. If a sensor breaks,
                    autopilot wont be able to sense the road properly, leaving a blindspot and room for an accidental accident, and potentially deaths for the user, 
                    and passengers on the road.
                </p>.

                <h2>False sense of Security</h2>
                <p>This is a risk that begins with the promotion of Autonomous Vehicles, but truly relies on the user and buyers ability to do research. This is the idea of getting to comfortable with the security of the 
                    saftey technology that is implemented. This starts with the promotion of security in these autonomous vehicles. A lot of these autonomous vehicles are being labelled "driverless" which causes
                    buyers and users to believe that the saftey features will keep them safe, which may not truly be the case. 
                </p>.

                <h2>Lack of Self-Driving Regulations</h2>
                <p>As of right now, this risk comes from the laws in place in regards to safety regulations in these vehicles. Since the field is still very new, and not many companies have decided to switch over to 
                    Autonomous Vehicles, saftey regulations are still fairly loose. Doing research and being able to know which car has the best saftey features for its autonomous features is important. If you happen to 
                    buy an autonomous car, for example a Tesla, and the company built the car to fit the loose regulation instead of improving it further to ensure better safety for users, then you could be at risk of an
                    accident.
                </p>.

                <h2>Real-Life Driving Conditions</h2>
                <p>This is a risk that comes from the outside world. Even though most driverless cars are promoted to have accident prevention features to swerve, and keep you away from accidents as you would manually as a driver,
                    the safety features are not always going to work. Drivers sitll need to be alert and aware of conditions in terms of traffic, other nearby cars, stop lights, stop signs, etc.
                </p>.

                <h2>Danger of Fire</h2>
                <p>The risk of Fire comes from the use of Lithium-ion batteries in most new Autonomous Vehicles, such as electric cars. Lithium-Ion Batteries are known to be highly combustable.
                    Once one of these batteries explodes in the car, the tempuratures can rise up to 3,632 degrees Fahrenheit. Attempting to put these flames out with water can result
                    to a Hydrogen Gas explosion.

                    If a collision were to damage one of these batteries in a collision, there is also a risk of thermal runway.
                    Thermal runway is the release of toxic gasses, release of projectiles, and an outburst of fire.
