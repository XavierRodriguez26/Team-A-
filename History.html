                        <p>The Self Propelled Car was a design created by Leonardo Davinci. Designed for festival use, the design was never fully invented, and simply stayed as a blueprint. It could be set to either go straight, or move at preset angles. </p>

                        <p>The Whitehead Torpedo was the first ever self-propelled torpedo to be developed. The torpedo's design was perfected in 1866 by Robert Whitehead from a rough draft design created by 
                            Giovanni Luppis. It was driven by three cylinder compressed-air engines. This torpedo was implemented into several different Navy services during the 1970's.

                        <p>The Radio Controlled Car was a radio operated car that used an antenna, and had a second car to follow as a transmitter for it. The Radio signals it used operated small electric motors that controlled the movement of the car.
                            Houdina publically demonstrated this car in New York City.

                        <p>The Stanford Cart was the first design to actually be brought to life. 
                            The cart could navigate using cameras and an early beta version of an AI. The Stanford Cart went through 43 years of development, and ups and downs.
                        The cart first became developed under the hands of a Mechanical Engineering Graduate student names James L. Adams. </p>

                        <p>The US Airforce Research Lab has been conducting research to test the possibility of expanding the range in UAV droves
                            as shown above, for expanding the range for unmanned aerial systems. The TACE Tech nology used is half autonomous AI system, and the autopilot.
                            This technology has been tested on the Lynx Drone. The system monitors commands being sent from the autonomoy to the autopilot and then sends back 
                            information on the state, position, speed, and orientation of the autonomy.</p>
